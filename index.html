     <h2>Booker T. Washington: 1890-1915 <br> (b.1856, d.1915)</h2>
   <p> Booker T. Washington was a more conservitive civil rights
     figure who advocated for a slow approach to civil rights
     to prevent backlash. This is most clearly shown in his
     <a href = 'https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog-post/booker-t-washington-and-atlanta-compromise'>
     Atlanta Compromise</a> despite initial support it was
     heavily criticized by W. E. B. Du Bois and other civil rights
     leaders for perpetuating Jim Crow stereotypes and restrictions
     rather than fighting them.

      <h2>W. E. B. Du Bois <br> 1905-1950(b.1868, d.1963)</h2>
      <p>W. E. B. Du Bois became a prominent civil rights figure after his foundation and leadership of the <a href = 'http://scua.library.umass.edu/duboisopedia/doku.php?id=about:niagara_movement'> Niagra Movment</a> he opposed
      the conservitive leaning <a href = 'https://nmaahc.si.edu/blog-post/booker-t-washington-and-atlanta-compromise'>
      Atlanta Compromise</a> created by Booker T. Washington. In 1909 Du Bois became a founding member of the NAACP.
      Du bois championed full civil rights, and believe this goal would be completed by the ~*“Talented Tenth”*~. He was also authored
      <a href = 'https://www.amazon.com/Souls-Black-Folk-W-Bois/dp/1612931073'> The Souls of Black Folk </a> and <a href = 'https://www.amazon.com/Black-Reconstruction-America-1860-1880-Burghardt/dp/0684856573'>
      Black Reconstruction</a> in America as well as other works. he was an influential figure in the NAACP
      however due to suspected communist sympathies in the late 40’s he resigned from the NAACP in 1948. Du Bois continued to support and
      work for civil rights until his death in 1963.</p>

    <h2> NAACP from 1909-1953 </h2>
    <p>The NAACP was founded in 1909 as a successor to the <a href = 'http://scua.library.umass.edu/duboisopedia/doku.php?id=about:niagara_movement'> Niagra Movment<a> and while
    taking other actions to advance civil rights, the NAACP’s most influential strategy
    would be the use of litigation to combat segregation. Starting as early as 1915 with
    guinn v. U.S. which struck down oklahoma's grandfather clause which was used to suppress voters.
    The NAACP continued to see success with this strategy most importantly with Brown v. Board of Education.</p>

    <h2>Brown v. Board of Education: 1953</h2>
    <p>A landmark case in civil rights was<a href = "https://tarlton.law.utexas.edu/clark/brown-v-board-of-education"> Brown v. Board of Education</a>. In this case the brown family’s daughter was denied
      the ability to go to the school closest to their home because segregation in schools. They and others sued the
      Topeka Board of Education on the grounds that the segregation of schools was unconstitutional. This case was a
      powerful symbolic victory as it in essence overturned the Plessy v Ferguson decided in 1896 which said that
      segregation was constitutional under the doctrine of “separate but equal”. Despite its success many southern
      states refused to follow federal law or found legal loopholes to bypass the decision. This was not helped by
      the vague wording of the decision saying that schools were to be desegregated with “all deliberate speed”.</P>

    <h2> Civil rights act of 1964 </h2>
    <p>The  <a href = "file:///C:/Users/class/Zotero/storage/RD6E2VUI/civil-rights-act-1964.html" > Civil Rights Act of 1964 </a>outlawed discrimination on the base of race, religon, sex or natinol origin. Despite opposition and struggle the
      bill was eventually passed and was a massive symbolic and legal victory, the laws limited options for pursuing legal recourse against violating
      \it were amended by further civil acts. This broke the back of jim crows laws though some would persist for years due to litigation methods to
      eliminate it was only a matter of time before they were ended. The civil rights act of 1964 is still essential today according to *the united
      states courts in 2013 alone 35,307 civil rights cases were filed in federal courts*</p>

    <h2> Effects of Segregation and Civil Rights Act of 1964 </h2>
    <p>Though the civil rights act of 1964 outlawed direct segregation, the fact was that many had already been denied,
       occupations, proper education, and had been forced into poverty. These problems did not evaporate with the passing
       of the act and the effects of poverty made the effects of segregation multi-generational, reaching far past the Jim Crow
       era. This among other issues is why on average schools and neighborhoods are still segregated today despite significant
       change in laws and customs. <br> Here are sources about systemic racism: <a href = "https://www.racialequitytools.org/resourcefiles/Definitions-of%20Racism.pdf" > A summary by academics and community advocates</a>, <a href = "https://www.americanprogress.org/issues/race/reports/2018/02/21/447051/systematic-inequality/"> summary from center of american progress </a></p>
